Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&weight=100&size=15&duration=2500&pause=1000&color=FF8787&vCenter=true&width=435&lines=I'm+a+Web+Developer;I'm+a+Back+End+Developer;I'm+a+Software+Developer;)

With over 3+ years of experience, I excel in developing robust and scalable web applications, specializing in back-end and full-stack development. My expertise includes building APIs using Laravel (PHP), Express.js, and AdonisJS (Node.js), as well as integrating relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. 

Additionally, I bring proficiency in front-end technologies like Vue.js, React.js, and jQuery, creating seamless, user-friendly interfaces. Continuously expanding my skill set, I am currently exploring Go (Golang) to further enhance my technical capabilities.
